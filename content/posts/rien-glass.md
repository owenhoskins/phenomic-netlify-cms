RIEN is a drinking glass, simultaneously delicate and stackable. The perfect glass for a drink at the bar, a wine or just some water.
A cone-shaped, curved base gives RIEN not only its unique form, but also additional functionality: when the base is full, it measures exactly 4cl.

Its robustness and heat resistance originates from its materialâ€™s properties: produced from borosilicate glass originally used in scientific research. (Available in 200ml and 300ml sizes)
